# Stock_Analysis

###Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a worksheet so to see the performance of stocks for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal was to refractor the code to have the program run as efficiently as possible.


###Results
With the initial code practiced in the module, I was able to run the program for the Year 2017 in 1.773438 seconds.

After refractoring the code the same year returned the same results in a shorter amount of time, only 0.2890625 seconds, which was a huge improvement.

I noticed the same trends for the year 2018 as well.

###Summary
There are some advantages and disadvantages to rewriting code. The advantage I noted in the analysis, was that overall the performance of the code was much faster. A disadvantage would be having to be careful to not accidentally delete something that worked fine before and losing your place in the code. Making comments and saving work often helped me work through those disadvantages.
